# STM32 Ultrasonic Sensor Project

This project uses an *STM32L073RZ Nucleo board* and an *HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor* to measure distance. Depending on the measured distance, the system behaves as follows:

- *Green LED* (D4 - PB5): Turns on if the distance is safe (greater than 50 cm)
- *Red LED* (D7 - PB4): Turns on if the object is too close (less than 20 cm)
- *Buzzer* (D8 - PB10): Sounds an alarm if the object is too close

## Hardware

- STM32 Nucleo-L073RZ board
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- 2 LEDs (red and green)
- Active buzzer
- 330Ω resistors
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## Pin Connections

| Component    | STM32 Pin | Header Pin |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Trig (Sensor)| PA0       | A0          |
| Echo (Sensor)| PA1       | A1          |
| Green LED    | PB5       | D4          |
| Red LED      | PB4       | D7          |
| Buzzer       | PB10      | D8          |

> For the Echo pin, use a 1kΩ–2kΩ resistor voltage divider to safely reduce the 5V signal to 3.3V.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create the project in *STM32CubeMX*
2. Set up Timer2 and configure the necessary GPIO pins
3. Copy the code into the main.c file
4. Generate code and build the project in *STM32CubeIDE*
5. Flash the firmware to the board
